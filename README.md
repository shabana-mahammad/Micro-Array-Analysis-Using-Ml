In Microarray Data Analysis, machine learning has undergone a significant transformation but still encounters substantial challenges due to the data's complex nature and high dimensionality. This research paper focuses on attribute reduction, a vital pre-processing step, and explores the microarray analysis field. The study reveals the application of the Fuzzy Discernibility Matrix and Fuzzy-Rough Sets to address dimensional reduction issues. Additionally, Hybrid Decision Systems are investigated to enhance classification accuracy in microarray data. The analysis aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of machine learning models within the microarray data analysis domain. One technique explored to manage the scalability challenges of high-dimensional datasets is MapReduce, a framework for parallel processing. Ultimately, this research contributes to the understanding of these methodologies and their potential to enhance analysis outcomes.
